## Installation

Add [`de.westnordost:osmapi-overpass:1.3`](https://maven-repository.com/artifact/de.westnordost/osmapi-overpass/1.3) as a Maven dependency or download the jar from there.
On Android, you need to exclude kxml2 from the dependencies since it is already built-in, like so:

```gradle
	compile ('de.westnordost:osmapi-overpass:1.3')
	{
		exclude group: 'net.sf.kxml', module: 'kxml2' // already included in Android
	}
```

## Example Usage

First, initialize the `OverpassMapDataDao`

```java
	OsmConnection connection = new OsmConnection("https://overpass-api.de/api/", "my user agent");
	OverpassMapDataDao overpass = new OverpassMapDataDao(connection);
```
